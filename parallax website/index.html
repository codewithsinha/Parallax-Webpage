        <h2>Why It Brings Me So Much Of Joy?</h2>
        <p>Eating ice cream instantly transports us back to wonderful childhood experiences. When we eat ice cream, our
            brain remembers those positive feelings and we learn to associate the treat with happiness. Of course, one
            cannot rely on ice cream alone for a happy, fulfilling life, but it certainly doesnâ€™t hurt to include is as
            part of a well-balanced, individual pursuit of happiness when eaten responsibly. Ice cream contains protein
            and fat, both of which our bodies need to help level our moods. On top of that, the amino acids you take in
            when eating ice cream, such as tryptophan, are known to increase serotonin production. That leaves us
            feeling calm, satisfied, and well, happy!
